## Predicting Cervical Cancer Risk  
  
__Overview__  
  
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer among women in the world. More than 10,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the US. Although each year cervical cancer kills about 4,000 women in the US, it is the most preventable type of cancer. Cervical cancer is highly preventable because many risk factors are known for initiation of the cancer. My aim is to examine the dataset, and use a classification model to predict whether a patient is diagnosed with cervical cancer or not.
